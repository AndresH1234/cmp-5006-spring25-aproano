    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework assignment, you will explore various aspects of web security through hands-on exercises. You will work with DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application), Kali Linux, and an open-source WAF (Web Application Firewall). This assignment is designed to give you practical experience with both offensive and defensive security techniques.\n",

    "  - Computer 2: Running DVWA and ModSecurity WAF (target/defender)\n",
    "- Duration: 2 weeks\n",
    "- Deliverable: A comprehensive report detailing your methodology, findings, and mitigation strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computer 1 (Attacker)**:\n",
    "   - Install Kali Linux (VM is acceptable)\n",
